This folder contains useful informations and files regarding Notepad++ and its
 copy to another machine.

Here you can also find my copy of the folders
- ***%appdata%/Notepad++/***
- ***%program files%/Notepad++/***

containing all settings and plugins I prefer.

### Copy to another machine
After you install Notepad++ on your computer, all the configurations will be
 saved in ***C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++***.

If you need to export Notepad++ settings, you can copy ***%appdata%\notepad++***
 from the old computer to the new one.

If you want to move the exact version of Notepad++, with all the same plugins
 already installed, you could try to copy over ***%program files (x86)%\notepad++***
directory (or ***%program files (x86)%\notepad++***, depending on your installation 
path) to the new computer.
